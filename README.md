# Welcome to this repository
This repository was created in order to train my Javascript knowledge and bring me to learn new things during my training at BeCode. 

I experiment with JavaScript basic functionnalities and concepts so I can get better at algorithms and programming later on.

This repository was started on November 24th 2022 during my training bootcamp.
